Patch: Improve certificate cards visuals

- Added CSS animations: entrance (cardEnter), sheen overlay, thumbnail zoom on hover.
- Added staggered animation delays for first 3 cards using :nth-child selectors.
- Added .featured-badge styling; applied a badge to the first certificate card.
- Ensured hover interactions remain smooth on mobile (only small transforms).
